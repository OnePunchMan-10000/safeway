# MongoDB Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up MongoDB for the Women Safety App. You have two options:

## Option 1: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud - Recommended)

MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service. It's easier to set up and doesn't require installing anything locally.

### Step 1: Create MongoDB Atlas Account

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
2. Click "Try Free" and create an account
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Create a Cluster

1. After logging in, click "Build a Database"
2. Select the **M0 FREE** tier
3. Choose a cloud provider and region closest to you
4. Give your cluster a name (e.g., "women-safety-app")
5. Click "Create Cluster" (this may take a few minutes)

### Step 3: Configure Database Access

1. In the left navigation menu, click "Database Access"
2. Click "Add New Database User"
3. Fill in the form:
   - Username: `safeway_user`
   - Password: Create a strong password (save this somewhere safe)
   - Permissions: Select "Atlas admin"
4. Click "Add User"

### Step 4: Configure Network Access

1. In the left navigation menu, click "Network Access"
2. Click "Add IP Address"
3. For development, you can:
   - Click "Add Current IP Address" to add your current IP
   - Or click "Allow Access From Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0) for easier development
4. Click "Confirm"

### Step 5: Get Connection String

1. Click "Database" in the left navigation menu
2. Click "Connect" on your cluster
3. Click "Connect your application"
4. Copy the connection string
5. Replace `<password>` with the password you created in Step 3

### Step 6: Update Your Environment File

In your project, update `backend/.env`:

```env
# Replace with your actual connection string
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://safeway_user:YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE@your-cluster-url.mongodb.net/women-safety-app?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

## Option 2: Local MongoDB Installation

If you prefer to run MongoDB locally:

### Windows Installation

1. Download MongoDB Community Server from [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
2. Run the installer with default settings
3. Choose "Complete" setup type
4. Select "Run service as Network Service user"
5. Choose default data directory (`C:\data\db`)
6. Complete the installation

### Start MongoDB Service

1. Create the data directory:
   ```cmd
   mkdir C:\data\db
   ```

2. Start MongoDB:
   ```cmd
   mongod
   ```

   Or if installed as a service:
   ```cmd
   net start MongoDB
   ```

### Update Your Environment File

In your project, update `backend/.env`:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/women-safety-app
```

## Testing Your Connection

After setting up either option:

1. Open a terminal in your project directory
2. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. Test the database connection:
   ```bash
   npm run test-db
   ```

If successful, you'll see:
```
âœ… Successfully connected to MongoDB
ðŸ§ª Testing basic database operations...
âœ… Insert operation successful
âœ… Query operation successful
âœ… Delete operation successful
ðŸ”’ Database connection closed

ðŸŽ‰ All database tests passed!
ðŸš€ The application is ready to use MongoDB for storing user details and emergency videos.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Refused**: Make sure MongoDB is running
2. **Authentication Failed**: Check your username and password
3. **IP Not Whitelisted**: Add your IP to the Network Access list in Atlas
4. **Firewall Issues**: Check if your firewall is blocking the connection

### Need Help?

If you're having trouble setting up MongoDB, you can still run the application with the in-memory storage fallback. However, some features like persistent data storage and advanced querying will be limited.
